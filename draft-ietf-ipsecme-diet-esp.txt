1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] protocol is part
   of the IPsec [RFC4301] suite of protocols and can provide
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, integrity, anti-replay,
   and traffic flow confidentiality.  The set of services ESP provides
   depends on the Security Association (SA) parameters negotiated
   between devices.

   An ESP packet is composed of the ESP Header, the ESP Payload, the ESP
   Trailer, and the Integrity Check Value (ICV).  ESP has two modes of
   operation: Transport and Tunnel.  In Transport mode, the ESP Payload
   consists of the payload of the original IP packet; the ESP Header is
   inserted after the original IP packet header.  In Tunnel mode,
   commonly used for VPNs, the ESP Header is placed after an outer IP
   header and before the inner IP packet headers of the original
   datagram.  This ensures both the original IP headers and payload are
   protected.  Consequently, the ESP Payload field contains either the
   payload from the original IP packet or the fully-encapsulated IP
   packet, in transport mode or tunnel mode, respectively.

   The ESP Trailer, placed at the end of the encrypted payload, includes
   fields such as Padding and Pad Length to ensure proper alignment, and
   Next Header to indicate the protocol following the ESP header.  The
   ICV, calculated over the ESP Header, ESP Payload, and ESP Trailer, is
   appended after the ESP Trailer to ensure packet integrity.  For a
   simplified overview of ESP, readers are referred to Minimal ESP
   [RFC9333].

   While ESP is effective in securing traffic, further optimization can
   reduce packet sizes, enhancing performance in networks with limited
   bandwidth.  In such environments, reducing the size of transmitted
   packets is essential to improve efficiency.  This document defines
   the ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP), namely Diet-ESP, for
   compression/decompression (C/D) of IPsec/ESP [RFC4301] / [RFC4303]
   packets using the Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation
   (SCHC) framework [RFC8724].  The structure of Diet-ESP is shown in
   Figure 1.  Compression with SCHC is based on the use of a Set of
   Rules (SoR) used in a SCHC instance for C/D operations
   [I-D.ietf-schc-architecture].  One or more SoR constitute the SCHC

   Context.  In the case of IPsec, the Context can be agreed via IKEv2
   [RFC7296] and its specific extension
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension].

   As a result of the application of the same SoR, header values shared
   by the end-points do not need to be sent on the wire.  At the
   receiver, header information is re-generated from the received
   compressed packet and the application of the proper SoR retrieved
   from the Context.

             Figure 1: Top-Level Format of an ESP Packet

   This document defines the ESP Header Compression profile (EHCP)
   Architecture with the application of SCHC at various layers of the
   IPsec stack---also called SCHC strata---as defined below:

   1.  Inner IP Compression (IIPC): The SoR used in this SCHC stratum
       apply directly to the headers of the inner IP packet.  For
       example, in the case of a UDP packet with ports determined by the
       SA, fields such as UDP ports and checksums are typically
       compressed.  If no compression of the inner packet is possible,
       the resulting SCHC packet contains the uncompressed IP packet, as
       per [RFC8724], Section 7.2.

   2.  Clear Text ESP Compression (CTEC): This SCHC stratum contains SoR
       that compress the fields of the ESP Payload, right before being
       encrypted, as the encapsulated traffic in tunnel mode.

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   3.  Encrypted ESP Compression (EEC): This SCHC stratum contains SoR
       that compress the ESP fields that remain visible after
       encryption, that is, the ESP Header.

   Note that the descriptions of the three SCHC strata provided in this
   document meet the general purpose of ESP.  It is possible that in
   some deployments, the SCHC instances from different SCHC layers can
   be merged.  Typically, a specific implementation may merge the
   compression of IIPC and CTEC layers.

   Each SoR indicates the ESP header fields to be matched by the rules.
   The SCHC instances define how the SCHC Context is initialized from
   the SA and generate the corresponding SCHC rules (i.e., RuleID, SCHC
   MAX_PACKET_SIZE, new SCHC Compression/Decompression Actions (CDA),
   and fragmentation).  The appendix provides illustrative examples of
   applications of EHCP implemented with the OpenSCHC [OpenSCHC].

3.  Terminology

   ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP):  A method to reduce the size
      of ESP headers using predefined compression rules and contexts to
      improve efficiency.

   ESP Trailer:  A set of fields added at the end of the ESP payload,
      including Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header, used to ensure
      alignment and indicate the next protocol.

   SCHC Stratum:  Refers to the specific layer in the ESP packet
      structure where the Set of Rules of a SCHC instance are applied
      for compression and decompression.

   Inner IP C/D (IIPC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, IIPC
      compresses/decompresses the inner IP packet headers.

   Clear Text ESP C/D (CTEC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, CTEC
      compresses/decompresses all fields that will later be encrypted by
      ESP, which include the ESP Data and ESP Trailer.

   Encrypted ESP C/D (EEC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, EEC
      compresses/decompresses ESP fields that will not be encrypted by
      ESP.

   Security Parameters Index (SPI):  As defined in [RFC4301],
      Section 4.1.

   Sequence Number (SN):  As defined in [RFC4303], Section 2.2.

   Static Context Header Compression (SCHC):  A framework for header

      compression designed for LPWANs, as defined in [RFC8724].

   Static Context Header Compression Rules (SCHC Rules):  As defined in
      [RFC8724], Section 5.

   RuleID:  A unique identifier for each SCHC rule, as defined in
      [RFC8724], Section 5.1.

   SCHC Context:  The set of rules shared between communicating
      entities, as defined in [RFC8724], Section 5.3.

   SCHC Parameters:  A set of predefined values used for SCHC
      compression and decompression, ensuring byte alignment and proper
      packet formatting based on the SCHC profile.

   SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE:  The maximum size of a SCHC-compressed packet
      that can be transmitted without fragmentation.

   Traffic Selector (TS):  A set of parameters (e.g., IP address range,
      port range, and protocol) used to define which traffic should be
      protected by a specific Security Association (SA).

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with other SCHC terminology
   defined in [RFC8376], [RFC8724], and [I-D.ietf-schc-architecture].

4.  SCHC Integration into the IPsec Stack

   The main principle of the ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP) is to
   avoid sending information that has already been shared by the peers.
   Different profiles and technologies, such as those defined by
   [RFC4301] and [RFC4303], ensure that ESP can be tailored to various
   network requirements and security policies.  However, ESP is not
   optimized for bandwidth efficiency because it has been designed as a
   general-purpose protocol.  EHCP aims to address this by leveraging a
   profile, expressed via the SCHC architecture, to optimize the ESP
   header sizes for better efficiency in constrained environments.

   Figure 2 illustrates the integration of SCHC into the IPsec stack,
   detailing the different layers and components involved in the
   compression and decompression processes.  The diagram is divided into
   two entities, each representing an endpoint of a communication link.

   Compression rules are derived from Security Association (SA)
   parameters negotiated through IKEv2 [RFC7296], such as Traffic
   Selectors (TS) and IPsec mode, as well as additional parameters
   explicitly defined in this document as Attributes for Rules
   Generation (AfRG) (see Section 4.3).  While TS and IPsec mode serve
   as inputs for compression, they are not traditionally categorized as



Migault, et al.           Expires 27 July 2025                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   AfRG.  This document introduces the concept of AfRG to unify these
   inputs and define the compression process.  To facilitate complete
   negotiation, any remaining AfRG parameters requiring explicit
   agreement are addressed through the IKEv2 extension
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension].

   Upon establishing the SA, Diet-ESP uses the AfRGs listed in Table 1
   for derivation of the SoR applicable to each SCHC stratum.  The
   collection of rules are then used for the SCHC Context
   initialization.  The reference column in Table 1 indicates the source
   where the parameter value is defined.  The C/D column specifies in
   which of the SCHC strata the parameter is being used.

   EHCP defines three SCHC strata for compression: Inner IP Compression
   (IIPC), Clear Text ESP Compression (CTEC), and Encrypted ESP
   Compression (EEC).  The compression operations for each stratum are
   described in Section 5.1, Section 5.3, and Section 5.4.

   EHCP essentially limits the scope of the compression to the inner IP
   headers and specific fields such as ports and checksums of transports
   like UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP, SCTP.  Further and more specific compression
   profiles may be defined in the future to cover compression of headers
   of different upper layer protocols.

   At the receiver endpoint, the decompression of the inbound packet
   follows a reverse process.  First, the Encrypted ESP C/D (EEC)
   decompresses the encrypted ESP header fields.  After the ESP packet
   is decrypted, the Clear Text ESP C/D (CTEC) decompresses the Clear
   Text fields of the ESP packet.

   Note that implementations MAY differ from the architectural
   description but it is assumed that the outputs will be the same.

      described for IPsec in tunnel mode.  C designates the Compressed
     header for the fields inside.  IIP refers to the Inner IP packet,
       EH refers to the ESP Header, and ET refers to the ESP Trailer.
         The labels "SCHC (IIPC: Compress Inner IP)," "SCHC (CTEC:
       Compress Trailer)," and "SCHC (EEC: Compress ESP Header)" are
       added to indicate that different SCHC instances are applied at
               the IIPC, CTEC, and EEC layers, respectively.

                Figure 3: Diet-ESP Compressed Header Format

   The SCHC Profile for Diet-ESP is defined as follows:

   RuleID:  The RuleID is a unique identifier for each SCHC rule.  It is
      included in packets to ensure the receiver applies the correct
      decompression rule, maintaining consistency in packet processing.
      Note that the Rule ID does not need to be explicitly agreed upon
      and can be defined independently by each party.  The RuleID in
      Diet-ESP is expressed as 1 byte.

   Maximum Packet Size:  MAX_PACKET_SIZE is determined by the specific
      IPsec ESP configuration and the underlying transport, but it is
      typically aligned with the networkâs MTU.  The size constraints
      are optimized based on the available link capacity and negotiated
      parameters between endpoints.

   SCHC Padding:  Padding in SCHC is used to align data to a specific
      boundary (typically byte-aligned or 8-bit aligned) to meet the
      requirements of the underlying link layer protocol or encryption
      algorithm.  Padding bits are often zero or follow a pattern but do
      not contain significant data.  In Diet-ESP, the SCHC padding is
      added in the CTEC strata to align the packet for encryption.

   The resulting IP/ESP packet size is variable.  In some networks, the
   packet will require fragmentation before transmission over the wire.
   Fragmentation is out of the scope of this document since it is
   dependent on the layer 2 technology.

   Figure 4 illustrates how the final compressed packet looks when using
   SCHC compression for ESP headers in the Diet-ESP profile.

4.2.  Set of Rules (SoR) for Diet-ESP

   SCHC SoR are predefined sets of instructions that specify how to
   compress and decompress the header fields of an ESP packet.  The
   identification of a particular SoR will follow the specification in
   [I-D.ietf-schc-architecture].

   Similarly to the SA, Rules are directional and the Direction
   Indicator (DI) is set to Up for outbound SA and Down for inbound SA.
   Each Rule also contains a Field Position parameter that is set to 1,
   unless specified otherwise.

4.3.  Attributes for Rules Generation

   The list of attributes for the Rules Generation (AfRG) is shown in
   Table 1.  These attributes are used to express the various
   compressions that operate at the IIPC, CTEC, and EEC layers.

   As outlined in Section 4, this specification does not detail the
   process by which the AfRG are established between peers.  Instead,
   such negotiations are addressed in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension].  However, the AfRG can
   be classified into two distinct categories.  The first category
   encompasses AfRG that are negotiated through a specific IKEv2
   extension tailored for the negotiation of AfRG linked to a particular
   profile, the Diet-ESP profile in this context.  The AfRG referenced
   in Table 1 in this category are: the DSCP Compression/Decompression

   Action (CDA) dscp_cda, the ECN CDA ecn_cda, the Flow Label CDA
   flow_label_cda, the ESP alignment alignment, the ESP SPI Least
   Significant Bits (LSB) esp_spi_lsb, and the ESP Sequence Number LSB
   esp_sn_lsb.

   The second category pertains to AfRG that are negotiated through
   IKEv2 exchanges or extensions that are not specifically designed for
   compression purposes.  This category includes AfRG associated with
   TS, as identified in Table 1, which are the TS IP Version
   ts_ip_version, the TS IP Source Start ts_ip_src_start, the TS IP
   Source End ts_ip_src_end, the TS IP Destination Start
   ts_ip_dst_start, the TS IP Destination End ts_ip_dst_end, the TS
   Protocol ts_proto, the TS Port Source Start ts_port_src_start, the TS
   Port Source End ts_port_src_end, the TS Port Destination Start
   ts_port_dst_start, and the TS Port Destination End ts_port_dst_end.
   These AfRG are derived from the Traffic Selectors established through
   TSi/TSr payloads during the IKEv2 CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, as
   described in [RFC7296], Section 3.13.  The AfRG IPsec Mode designated
   as ipsec_mode in Table 1 is determined by the presence or absence of
   the USE_TRANSPORT_MODE Notify Payload during the CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchange, as detailed in [RFC7296], Section 1.3.1.  The AfRG Tunnel
   IP designated as tunnel_ip in Table 1 is obtained from the IP address
   of the IKE messages exchanged during the CREATE_CHILD_SA process, as
   noted in [RFC7296], Section 1.1.3.  The AfRGs designated as ESP
   Encryption Algorythm esp_encr and ESP Security Parameter Index (SPI)
   esp_spi in Table 1 are established through the SAi2/SAr2 payloads
   during the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, while the AfRG designated as ESP
   Sequence Number esp_sn in Table 1 is initialized upon the creation of
   the Child SA and incremented for each subsequent ESP message.

   The ability to derive the EHCP Context for the IIPC from the agreed
   Traffic Selectors is indicated by the variable iipc_profile.

                     Table 1: EHCP related parameters

   Any parameter starting with "ts_" is associated with the Traffic
   Selectors (TSi/TSr) of the SA.  The notation is introduced by this
   specification but the definitions of the parameters are in [RFC4301]
   and [RFC7296].



Migault, et al.           Expires 27 July 2025                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   The Traffic Selectors may result in a quite complex expression, and
   this specification restricts that complexity.  This specification
   restricts the resulting TSi/TSr to a single type of IP address (IPv4
   or IPv6), a single protocol (e.g., UDP, TCP, or ANY), a single port
   range for source and destination.  This specification presumes that
   the Traffic Selectors can be articulated as a result of
   CREATE_CHILD_SA with only one Traffic Selector [RFC7296],
   Section 3.13.1 in both TSi and TSr payloads (as described in
   [RFC7296], Section 3.13).  The TS Type MUST be either
   TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE or TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE.

   Let the resulting Trafic Selectors TSi/TSr be expressed via the
   Traffic Selector structure defined in [RFC7296], Section 3.13.1.  We
   designate the local TS the TS - either TSi or TSr - sent by the local
   peer.  Conversely we designate as remote TS the TS - either TSi or
   TSr - sent by the remote peer.

   The details of each parameter are the following:

   iipc_profile:  designates the profile used by IIPC.  When set to
      "iipc_uncompress" IIPC is not performed.  This specification
      describes IIPC that corresponds to the "iipc_diet-esp" profile.

   flow_label_cda:  indicates the Flow Label CDA, that is how the Flow
      Label field of the inner IPv6 packet or the Identification field
      of the inner IPv4 packet is compressed / decompressed - See
      Section 4.3.1 for more information.  In a nutshell, "uncompress"
      indicates that Flow Label (resp.  Identification) are not
      compressed. "lower" indicates the value is read from the outer IP
      header - eventually with some adaptations when inner IP packet and
      outer IP packets have different versions. "generated" indicates
      that the field is generated by the receiving party.  In that case,
      the decompressed value may take a different value compared to its
      original value. "zero" indicates the field is set to zero.

   dscp_cda:  indicates the DSCP CDA, that is how the DSCP values of the
      inner IP packet are compressed / decompressed - See Section 4.3.1
      for more information.  In a nutshell, "uncompress" indicates that
      DSCP are not compressed. "lower" indicates the value is read from
      the outer IP header - eventually with some adaptations when inner
      IP packet and outer IP packets have different versions.  "sa"
      indicates, compression is performed according to the DSCP values
      agreed by the SA (dscp_list).

   ecn_cda:  indicates ECN CDA, that is how the ECN values of the inner

      IP packet are compressed / decompressed - See Section 4.3.1 for
      more information.  In a nutshell, "uncompress" indicates that DSCP
      are not compressed. "lower" indicates the value is read from the
      outer IP header - eventually with some adaptations when inner IP
      packet and outer IP packets have different versions.

   ts_ip_version:  designates the TS IP version.  Its value is set to
      "IPv4-only" when only IPv4 IP addresses are considered and to
      "IPv6-only" when only IPv6 addresses are considered.  Practically,
      when IKEv2 is used, it means that the agreed TSi or TSr results
      only in a mutually exclusive combination of TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE or
      TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE payloads.  If TS Type of the resulting TSi/TSr
      is set to TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE, ts_ip_version takes the value
      "IPv4-only".  Respectively, if TS Type is set to
      TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE, ts_ip_version is set to "IPv6-only".

   ts_ip_src_start:  designates the TS IP Source Start, that is the
      starting value range of source IP addresses of the inner packet
      and has the same meaning as the Starting Address field of the
      local TS.

   ts_ip_src_end:  designates TS IP Source End that is the high end
      value range of source IP addresses of the inner packet and has the
      same meaning as the Ending Address field of the local TS.

   ts_ip_dst_start:  designates the TS IP Destination Start, that is the
      starting value range of destination IP addresses of the inner
      packet and has the same meaning as the Starting Address field of
      the remote TS.

   ts_ip_dst_end:  designates the TS IP Destination End, that is the
      high end value range of destination IP addresses of the inner
      packet and has the same meaning as the Ending Address field of the
      remote TS.

   ts_proto:  designates the TS Protocol, that is the Protocol ID of the
      resulting TSi/TSr.  This profile considers the specific protocol
      values "TCP", "UDP", "UDP-Lite", "SCTP" and "ANY".  The
      representation of "ANY" is given in [RFC4301], Section 4.4.4.2.

   ts_port_src_start:  designates the TS Port Source Start, that is the
      the starting value of the source port range of the inner packet
      and has the same meaning as the Start Port field of the local TS.

   ts_port_src_end:  designates the TS Port Source End, that is the high
      end value range of the source port range of the inner packet and
      has the same meaning as the End Port field of the local TS.

   ts_port_dst_start:  designates TS Port Destination Start, that is the
      starting value of the destination port range of the inner packet
      and has the same meaning as the Start Port field of the remote TS.

   ts_port_dst_end:  designates TS Port Destination End, that is the
      high end value range of the destination port range of the inner
      packet and has the same meaning as the End Port field of the
      remote TS.

   IP addresses and ports are defined as a range and compressed using
   the Least Significant Bits (LSB).  For a range defined by start and
   end values, msb( start, end ) is defined as the function that returns
   the Most Significant Bits (MSB) that remains unchanged while the
   value evolves between start and end.  Similarly, lsb( start, end ) is
   defined as the function that returns the LSB that changes while the
   value evolves between start and end.  Finally, len( x ) is defined as
   the function that returns the number of bits of the bit array x.

   dscp_list:  designates the list of DSCP values associated to the
      inner traffic - see for example [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-dscp-np].  These
      are not Traffic Selectors, but the compression mandates that the
      packets take one of these listed DSCP values.

   alignment:  designates the ESP alignment as defined by [RFC4303].

   ipsec_mode:  designates the IPsec Mode defined in [RFC4301].  In this
      document, the possible values are "tunnel" for the Tunnel mode and
      "transport" for the Transport mode.

   tunnel_ip:  designates the Tunnel IP address of the tunnel defined in
      [RFC4301].  This field is only applicable when the Tunnel mode is
      used.  That IP address can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   esp_encr:  designates the ESP Encryption Algorithm - also designated
      as Transform 1 in [RFC7296], Section 3.3.2.  The algorithm is
      needed to determine whether the ESP Payload Data needs to be
      aligned to some predefined block size and if the ESP Pad Length
      and Padding fields can be compressed.  For the purpose of
      compression it is RECOMMENDED to use algorithms that already
      compressed their IV [RFC8750].

   esp_spi:  designates the Security Parameter Index defined in
      [RFC4301].

   esp_spi_lsb:  designates the LSB to be considered for the compressed
      SPI.  A value of 32 for esp_spi_lsb will leave the SPI unchanged.

   esp_sn:  designates the ESP Sequence Number (SN) field defined in

      [RFC4301].

   esp_sn_lsb:  designates the LSB to be considered for the compressed
      SN.  It works similarly to ESP SPI LSB (see esp_spi_lsb).

4.3.1.  Compression/Decompression Actions in Diet-ESP

   In addition to the Compression/Decompression Actions (CDAs) defined
   in [RFC8724], Section 7.4, this specification uses the CDAs presented
   in Table 2.  These CDAs are either a refinement of the compute- * CDA

5.  SCHC Compression for IPsec in Tunnel mode

5.1.  Inner IP Compression (IIPC)

   When iipc_profile is set to "iipc_uncompress", the packet is
   uncompressed.  When iipc_profile is set to "iipc_diet-esp", IIPC
   proceeds to the compression of the inner IP Packet composed of an IP
   Header and an IP Payload.  The compression of the inner IP Payload is
   described in Section 5.1.1.
   The IP Header is compressed when ipsec_mode is set to "Tunnel" and
   left uncompressed otherwise. ts_ip_version determines how the IPv6
   Header (resp. the IPv4 header) is compressed - see Section 5.1.2
   (resp.  Section 5.1.3).

5.1.1.  Inner IP Payload Compression

   The compression only affects UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP or SCTP packets and
   the type of packet is determined by the IP header.

   For UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP and SCTP packets, source ports, destination
   ports, and checksums are compressed.  For source port (resp.
   destination port) only the least significant bits are sent.  FL is
   set to 16 bits, TV is set to msb( ts_port_src_start, ts_port_src_end
   ) ( resp. ts_port_dst_start, ts_port_dst_end ), MO is set to "MSB"
   and CDA to "LSB".  The checksum is elided, FL is set to 16 bits, TV
   is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "checksum".  This
   may result in decompressing a zero-checksum UDP packet with a valid
   checksum, but this has no impact as a valid checksum is universally
   accepted.

   For UDP or UDP-Lite the length field is elided.  FL is set to 16, TV
   is not set, MO is set to "ignore".

5.1.2.  Inner IPv6 Header Compression

   The version field is elided, FL is set to 3, TV is set to
   ts_ipversion, MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".

   Traffic Class is composed of the 6 bit DSCP and 2 bit ECN.  The
   compression of DSCP and ECN are defined independently.

   DSCP values are compressed according to the dscp_cda value:

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   *  If dscp_cda is set to "uncompress", the DSCP values are included
      in the inner IP header.  FL is set to 6 bits, TV is not set, MO is
      set to "ignore", CDA is set to "sent-value".

   *  If dscp_cda is set to "lower", the DSCP field is elided and its
      value is copied from the Tunnel IP header.  FL is set to 6 bits,
      TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is set to "lower".

   *  If dscp_cda is set to "sa", DSCP is compressed according to the
      DSCP values of the SA.  If dscp_list contains a single element,
      the DSCP is elided, FL is set to 6 bits, TV is set to
      dscp_list[0], MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".
      If dscp_list contains more than one DSCP value, FL is set to 6
      bits, TV is set to dscp_list, MO is set to "match-mapping" and the
      CDA is set to "mapping-sent".  For ECN, FL is set to 2 bits, TV is
      not set, MO is set to ignore and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   ECN values are compressed according to the ecn_cda value:

   *  If ecn_cda is set to "uncompress", the ECN field is included in
      the inner IP header.  FL is set to 2 bits, TV is not set, MO is
      set to "ignore", CDA is set to "sent-value".

   *  If ecn_cda is set to "lower", the ECN value is elided and the ECN
      value is copied in the outer IP header.  FL is set to 2 bits, TV
      is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is set to "lower".

   Flow label is compressed according to the flow_label_cda value:

   *  If flow_label_cda is set to "uncompress", the Flow label is
      included in the IPv6 Header.  FL is set to 20 bits, TV is not set,
      MO is set to "ignore", and CDA is set to "sent-value".

   *  If flow_label_cda is set to "lower", the Flow Label is elided and
      read from the outer IP Header (See Section 4.3.1).  FL is set to
      20 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", and CDA is set to
      "lower".  If the outer IP header is an IPv4 header, only the 16
      LSB of the Flow Label are inserted into the IPv4 Header.  At the
      decompression, the 4 MSB of the Flow Label are set to 0.

   *  If flow_label_cda is set to "generated", the Flow Label is elided
      and the Flow Label is then re-generated at the decompression (See
      Section 4.3.1).  The resulting Flow Label differs from the initial
      value.  FL is set to 20, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and
      CDA is set to "generated".

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   *  If flow_label_cda is set to "zero", the Flow Label is elided and
      set to 0 at decompression.  A 0 value indicates no flow label is
      present.  Fl is set to 20 bits, TV is set to 0, MO is set to
      "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".

   Payload Length is elided and determined from the Tunnel IP Header
   Payload Length as well as the decompressed Payload.  FL is set to 16
   bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is set to "lower".

   Next Header is compressed according to ts_proto:

   *  If ts_proto is the single value 0, Next Header is not compressed.
      FL is set to 8 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is
      set to "sent-value".

   *  If ts_proto is a single non zero value, Next Header is compressed.
      FL is set to 8 bits, TV is set to ts_proto, MO is set to "equal"
      and CDA is set to "not-sent".

   The IPv6 Hop Limit is read from the Tunnel IP Header Hop Limit.  FL
   is set to 8 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set
   to "lower."

   The source and destination IPv6 addresses are compressed using MSB.
   In both cases, FL is set to 128, TV is respectively set to
   msb(ts_ip_src_start, ts_ip_src_ed) or msb(ts_ip_dst_start,
   ts_ip_dst_end), the MO is set to "MSB," and the CDA is set to "LSB."

5.1.3.  Inner IPv4 Header Compression

   The fields Version, DSCP, ECN, Source Address and Destination Address
   are compressed as described for IPv6 in Section 5.1.2.  The field
   Total Length (16 bits) is compressed similarly to the IPv6 field
   Payload Length.  The field Identification (16 bits) is compressed
   similarly to the IPv6 field Flow Label.  If the tunnel IP Header is
   an IPv6 Header, the Identification is placed as the LSB of the IPv6
   Header and the 4 remaining MSB are set to 0.  The field Time to Live
   is compressed similarly to the IPv6 Hop Limit field.  The Protocol
   field is compressed similarly to the last IPv6 Next Header field.

   The Internet Header Length (IHL) is uncompressed, FL is set to 4
   bits, TV is not set, MO is set to ignore and CDA is set to "value-
   sent".

   The IPv4 Header checksum is elided.  FL is set to 16, TV is omitted,
   MO is set to "ignore," and CDA is set to "checksum."

5.2.  ESP Payload Data Byte Alignment

   SCHC operates on bits, and the compression performed by SCHC may
   result in a bit payload that is not aligned to a byte (8 bits)
   boundary.  Protocols such as ESP expect payloads to be aligned to
   byte boundaries (8-bit alignment).  To ensure this, we apply a
   padding by appending the SCHC_padding bits and the SCHC_padding_len.
   SCHC_padding_len is encoded over 3 bits to encode the number of bits
   that will compose the SCHC_padding field.  As a result SCHC_padding
   field has between 0 and 7 bits coded over the SCHC_padding_len.  The
   two fields are between 3 and 10 bits, so if the complementing bits
   are less than or equal to 2 bits, the padding will result in adding
   an extra byte.

   When the iipc_profile is set to "iipc_uncompress" there is no ESP
   Payload Data Byte alignment.  When iipc_profile is set to "iipc_diet-
   esp" ESP Payload Data Byte Alignment is performed over the Compressed
   Inner IP packet.  This ensures that in both transport and tunnel
   mode, the Payload Data later encrypted by ESP result in an integer
   number of bytes.

5.3.  Clear Text ESP Compression (CTEC)

   Once the Inner IP Packet has undergone compression as outlined in
   Section 5.1, followed by the ESP Byte Alignment detailed in
   Section 5.2, the resulting compressed inner packet comprises a
   specific number of bytes.  To construct the Clear Text ESP Packet, it
   is necessary to ascertain the ESP Payload Data, the Next Header, the
   Pad Length, and the Padding fields.

   In transport mode, the IP header of the inner packet remains
   uncompressed during the IIPC phase, and the ESP Payload Data is
   derived from the inner packet.  Conversely, in tunnel mode, the
   Payload Data encompasses the entirety of the inner packet.

   In transport mode, the Next Header field is obtained from either the
   inner IP Header or the Security Association, as specified in
   Section 5.1.3 or Section 5.1.2.  In tunnel mode, the Next Header is
   elided, as it is determined by ts_ip_version.  FL is set to 8 bit, TV
   is set to IPv4 or IPv6 depending on ts_ip_version, MO is set to
   "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".

   The ESP Pad Length and Padding fields are omitted only when ESP
   alignment has been selected to "8bit" and esp_encr does not
   necessitate a specific block size alignment, or if that block size is
   one byte.  This is represented by setting FL to (Pad Length + 1) * 8
   bits, leaving TV unset, configuring MO to "ignore," and designating
   CDA as padding.  The ESP Padding and Pad Length may vary from their



Migault, et al.           Expires 27 July 2025                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   decompressed counterparts.  However, since the IPsec process removes
   the padding, these variations do not affect packet processing.  When
   esp_encr requires a specific block size, the ESP Pad Length and
   Padding fields remain uncompressed.

5.4.  Encrypted ESP Compression (EEC)

   SPI is compressed to its LSB.  FL is set to 32 bits, TV is not set,
   MO is set to "MSB( 4 - esp_spi_lsb)" and CDA is set to "LSB".

   SN is compressed to their LSB, similarly to the SPI.  FL is set to 32
   bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "MSB( 4 - esp_sn_lsb)" and CDA is
   set to "LSB".

6.  SCHC Compression for IPsec in Transport mode

   The transport mode mostly differs from the Tunnel mode in that the IP
   header of the packet is not encrypted.  As a result, the IP Payload
   is compressed as described in Section 5.1.1.  The IP header is not
   compressed.  The byte alignment of the Compressed Payload is
   performed as described in Section 5.2.  The Clear Text ESP
   Compression is performed as described in Section 5.3 except for the
   Next Header Field, which is compressed as described in Section 5.1.2.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations encompass those outlined in ESP [RFC4303]
   as well as those pertaining to SCHC [RFC8724].

   When employing ESP [RFC4303] in Tunnel Mode, the complete inner IP
   packet is safeguarded against man-in-the-middle attacks through
   cryptographic means, rendering it virtually impossible for an
   attacker to alter any fields associated with either the inner IP
   header or the inner IP payload.  This level of protection is achieved
   by configuring the Flow Label CDA Value to "uncompress," the DSCP CDA
   Value to either "uncompress" or "sa," and the ECN CDA Value to
   "uncompress."





















Migault, et al.           Expires 27 July 2025                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   However, this protection is compromised if the Flow Label CAD Value,
   DSCP CAD Value, or ECN CDA Values are set to "lower."  In such cases,
   the values from the inner packet for the respective fields will be
   derived from the outer IP header, leaving these fields unprotected.
   It is important to note that even the Authentication Header [RFC4302]
   does not provide protection for these fields.  When associated with a
   CDA value of "lower," the level of protection is akin to that
   provided in Transport mode.  This vulnerability could be exploited by
   an attacker within an untrusted domain, potentially disrupting load
   balancing strategies that rely on the Flow Label [RFC6438][RFC6437].
   More broadly, when the Flow Label CAD Value is set to "lower," the
   relevant Flow Label Security Considerations from [RFC6437] apply.
   Additionally, an attacker may manipulate the DSCP values to diminish
   the priority of specific packets, resulting in packets from the same
   flow having varying priorities, traversing different paths, and
   introducing additional latency to applications, thereby facilitating
   DDoS attacks.  Consequently, these fields remain unprotected and are
   susceptible to modification during transmission, which may also be
   regarded as an acceptable risk.

   When the Flow Label CDA Value is designated as "generated" or "zero,"
   an attacker is unable to exploit the Flow Label field in any manner.
   The inner packet received is anticipated to possess a Flow Label
   distinct from that of the original encapsulated packet.  However, the
   Flow Label is assigned by the receiving gateway.  When the value is
   set to "zero," it is known, whereas when it is designated as
   "generated," it must be produced in accordance with the
   specifications outlined in [RFC6437].

   The DSCP CDA Value is assigned as "sa" when DSCP values are linked to
   Security Associations (SAs), but it should not be utilized when all
   DSCP values are encompassed within a single SA.  In such instances,
   "uncompress" is recommended.

   The encryption algorithm must adhere to the guidelines provided in
   [RFC8221] to guarantee contemporary cryptographic protection.

   The least significant bits (LSB) of the ESP Security Parameter Index
   (SPI) determine the number of bits allocated to the SPI.  An
   acceptable quantity of LSB must ensure that the peer possesses a
   sufficient number of SPIs, which is contingent upon the
   implementation of the SA lookup employed.  If a peer relies solely on
   the SPI fields for SA lookup, then the LSB must be sufficiently large
   to satisfy the condition MAX_SPI <= 2**LSB.  The SPI may assume
   various LSB values; however, the operator must be cognizant that if
   multiple LSB values are permissible for each type of SA lookup, then
   multiple SA lookups and signature verifications may be required.  It
   is advisable for a peer to ascertain the LSB associated with an
   incoming packet in a deterministic manner.

   The ESP SN LSB must be established in a manner that allows the
   receiving peer to clearly ascertain the sequence number of the IPsec
   packet.  If this requirement is not met, it will lead to an invalid
   signature verification, resulting in the rejection of the packet.
   Furthermore, the LSB should have the capacity to accommodate the
   maximum number of packets that may be in transit simultaneously.
   This approach will guarantee that the last packet received is
   correctly linked to the corresponding sequence number.

A.1.  JSON Representation of SCHC Rules for Diet-ESP Header Compression

   The JSON file defines a set of rules within the SCHC_Context that are
   used for compressing and decompressing ESP headers.  Each rule has a
   RuleID, a Description, and a set of Fields.  Each field specifies how
   a particular part of the packet should be handled during compression
   or decompression.  Note that the RuleID can be set by the user in any
   numeric order.  The rules include all the compression_levels,
   including IIPC, CTEC, and EEC as defined in the Terminology section.

A.2.  Example Outcome

A.2.1.  Input Packet

   The following packet undergoes processing based on the SCHC Diet-ESP
   profile:

   *  *IPv6 Header*:

      -  Source Address: 2001:db8::1000

      -  Destination Address: ff02::5678

      -  Other attributes include Payload Length: 18, Next Header: UDP,
         and Hop Limit: 64.

   *  *UDP Header*:

      -  Source Port: 123

      -  Destination Port: 4567

      -  Length: 18

      -  Checksum: 0x6bc9

   *  *Payload*:

      -  10 bytes sample Data: b'U\xe2(\x88\xbf\xf9\xd91\x08\xc5'

A.2.2.  Compression Process

   1.  *UDP Header Compression*:

       *  Initial size: 8 bytes.

       *  Compressed using the UDP-specific rules from the Diet-ESP
          profile.



Migault, et al.           Expires 27 July 2025                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


       *  Ports are encoded as LSB fields, reducing the size to 2 bytes.

   2.  *IPv6 Header Compression*:

       *  Initial size: 40 bytes.

       *  Source and destination addresses are compressed using value-
          sent rules based on matching prefixes.

       *  Final compressed size: 17 bytes.

   3.  *ESP Header Compression*:

       *  Initial size: 12 bytes.

       *  SPI is not transmitted (not-sent CDA), and SEQ is compressed
          using the LSB technique.

       *  Final compressed size: 2 bytes.

   4.  *ESP Clear Text Compression*:

       *  The ESP.NXT field (Next Header) is compressed using the match-
          mapping CDA: Rule: The ESP.NXT value is matched to a single
          value (41 for the IPv6 Next Header).  CDA: mapping-sent is
          used to send only the mapped index.

   5.  *Payload Handling*:

       *  The payload is not compressed.  Further compression may be
          possible with additional SCHC rules.

A.2.3.  Decompression Process

   The decompression reverses the steps:

   1.  *ESP Header Reconstruction*:

       *  SPI is restored using the fixed value from the rule (TV=5).

       *  SEQ is reconstructed from the LSB field.

   2.  *ESP Clear Text Reconstruction*:

       *  The ESP.NXT field is restored using the mapping-sent rule,
          where the value 41 (Next Header for IPv6) is retrieved from
          the mapping.

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   3.  *UDP Header Reconstruction*:

       *  Ports are restored using the compressed LSB values.

       *  Length and checksum fields are calculated using compute-length
          and compute-checksum CDA.

   4.  *IPv6 Header Reconstruction*:

       *  Prefixes are restored using the value-sent fields in the rule.

   5.  *Payload Restoration*:

       *  The payload is directly restored, as it was not compressed.

A.2.4.  Final Output Packet

   After reconstruction, the packet is identical to the original input:

   *  *IPv6 Header*:

      -  Source Address: 2001:db8::1000

      -  Destination Address: ff02::5678

      -  Payload Length: 18

      -  Next Header: UDP

      -  Hop Limit: 64.

   *  *UDP Header*:

      -  Source Port: 123

      -  Destination Port: 4567

      -  Length: 18

      -  Checksum: 0x6bc9.

   *  *Payload*:

      -  Data: b'U\xe2(\x88\xbf\xf9\xd91\x08\xc5'.

   This example demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the Diet-ESP
   profile when applied to compress and decompress network packets.

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      January 2025


   *  *Efficiency*: The SCHC rules reduce packet overhead:

      -  The UDP header is compressed from 8 bytes to 2 bytes.

      -  The IPv6 header is reduced from 40 bytes to 17 bytes.

      -  The ESP header size is decreased from 12 bytes to 2 bytes.

      -  The ESP.NXT field is eliminated from transmission (1 byte
         reduction).

      These reductions are particularly beneficial in constrained
      environments such as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs).

   *  *Accuracy*: The decompression process fully reconstructs the
      original packet, ensuring no loss of information.

   *  *Applicability*: By leveraging these rules, the Diet-ESP profile
      addresses the challenges of transmitting data efficiently in
      constrained networks, optimizing bandwidth utilization while
      retaining compatibility with standard protocols.
