                     ESP Header Compression Profile
                     draft-ietf-ipsecme-diet-esp-02

Abstract

   The document specifies Diet-ESP, an ESP Header Compression Profile
   (EHCP) that compresses IPsec/ESP communications using Static Context
   Header Compression (SCHC).

   Diet-ESP assumes the Traffic Selectors of the Security Association
   (SA) can be expressed by a single IKEv2 Traffic Selector Payload
   [RFC7296], Section 3.13.1.  More specifically, the Traffic Selectors
   are defined with a single type of IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6), a
   single IP range, a single protocol (such as UDP, TCP, or not
   relevant), a single port range and multiple DSCP numbers.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] protocol is part of
   the IPsec[RFC4301] suite protocols and provides confidentiality, data
   origin authentication, integrity, anti-replay, and traffic flow
   confidentiality.  The set of services ESP provides depends on the
   Security Association (SA) parameters negotiated between devices.

   An ESP packet is composed of an ESP Header, an ESP Payload and an
   Integrity Check Value (ICV). and ESP Trailer.  The ESP Payload is
   encrypted and its corresponding clear text includes ESP Data and an
   ESP Trailer.  The ESP Data contains either the original IP payload
   or, in tunnel mode, the full encapsulated IP packet.  The ESP
   Trailer, placed at the end of the ESP Payload, includes fields such
   as Padding, Pad Length to ensure proper alignment and Next Header to
   indicate the protocol following the ESP Header.  The ICV is
   calculated over the ESP Header, the ESP Payload, and trailer to
   maintain packet integrity.  To better understand ESP, the reader
   might be interested in reading Minimal ESP [RFC9333], a simplified
   version of ESP.

   While ESP is effective in securing traffic, further optimization can
   reduce packet sizes, enhancing performance in networks with limited
   bandwidth.  In such environments, reducing the size of transmitted
   packets is essential to improve efficiency.  This document defines
   the ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP) Diet-ESP for compression/
   decompression (C/D) ESP packets as represented in Figure 1, using
   Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) [RFC8724].  Compression with
   SCHC is based on using a set of Rules (SoR), which constitutes the
   Context of SCHC C/D.  Since we are using IPsec, this Context can be
   agreed via IKEv2 [RFC7296] and its specific extension
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension].

   As a result, any information that can be generated from the received
   compressed packet and the SCHC Context is not sent on the wire, thus
   reducing the ESP packet size on the wire.

             Figure 1: Top-Level Format of an ESP Packet

   This document defines the ESP Header Compression profile (EHCP)
   Architecture with the application of SCHC at various layers of the
   IPsec stack -- also called SCHC strata -- as defined below:

   1.  Inner IP Compression (IIPC): The SoR used in this SCHC stratum
       apply directly to the headers of the inner IP packet.  For
       example, in the case of a UDP packet with ports determined by the
       SA, fields such as UDP ports and checksums are typically
       compressed.  If no compression of the inner packet is possible,
       the resulting SCHC packet contains the uncompressed IP packet, as
       per [RFC8724], Section 7.2.

   2.  Clear Text ESP Compression (CTEC): This SCHC stratum contains SoR
       that compress the fields of the ESP Payload, right before being
       encrypted, as the encapsulated traffic in tunnel mode.

   3.  Encrypted ESP Compression (EEC): This SCHC stratum contains SoR
       that compress the ESP fields that remain visible after
       encryption, that is, the ESP Header.

   Note that the descriptions of the three SCHC strata provided in this
   document meet the general purpose of ESP.  It is possible that in
   some deployments, the SCHC instances from different SCHC layers can
   be merged.  Typically, a specific implementation may merge the
   compression of IIPC and CTEC layers.

   Each SoR indicates the ESP header fields to be matched by the rules.
   The SCHC instances define how the SCHC Context is initialized from
   the SA and generate the corresponding SCHC rules (i.e., RuleID, SCHC
   MAX_PACKET_SIZE, new SCHC Compression/Decompression Actions (CDA),
   and fragmentation).  The appendix provides illustrative examples of
   applications of EHCP implemented with the OpenSCHC [OpenSCHC].

3.  Terminology

   ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP):  A method to reduce the size
      of ESP headers using predefined compression rules and contexts to
      improve efficiency.

   ESP Trailer:  A set of fields added at the end of the ESP payload,
      including Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header, used to ensure
      alignment and indicate the next protocol.

   SCHC Stratum:  Refers to the specific layer in the ESP packet
      structure where the Set of Rules of a SCHC instance are applied
      for compression and decompression and applied.

   Inner IP C/D (IIPC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, IIPC
      compresses/decompresses the inner IP packet headers.

   Clear Text ESP C/D (CTEC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, CTEC
      compresses/decompresses all fields that will later be encrypted by
      ESP, which include the ESP Data ESP Trailer.

   Encrypted ESP C/D (EEC):  Expressed via the SCHC framework, EEC
      compresses/decompresses ESP fields that will not be encrypted by
      ESP.

   Security Parameters Index (SPI):  As defined in [RFC4301],
      Section 4.1.

   Sequence Number (SN):  As defined in [RFC4303], Section 2.2.

   Static Context Header Compression (SCHC):  A framework for header
      compression designed for LPWANs, as defined in [RFC8724].

   Static Context Header Compression Rules (SCHC Rules):  As defined in
      [RFC8724], Section 5.

   RuleID:  A unique identifier for each SCHC rule, as defined in
      [RFC8724], Section 5.1.

   SCHC Context:  The set of rules shared between communicating
      entities, as defined in [RFC8724], Section 5.3.

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      October 2024


   SCHC Parameters:  A set of predefined values used for SCHC
      compression and decompression, ensuring byte alignment and proper
      packet formatting based on the SCHC profile.

   SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE:  The maximum size of a SCHC-compressed packet
      that can be transmitted without fragmentation.

   Traffic Selector (TS):  A set of parameters (e.g., IP address range,
      port range, and protocol) used to define which traffic should be
      protected by a specific Security Association (SA).

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with other SCHC terminology
   defined in [RFC8376], [RFC8724], and [I-D.ietf-schc-architecture].

4.  SCHC Integration into the IPsec Stack

   The main principle of the ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP) is to
   avoid sending information that has already been shared by the peers.
   Different profiles and technologies, such as those defined by
   [RFC4301] and [RFC4303], ensure that ESP can be tailored to various
   network requirements and security policies.  However, ESP is not
   optimized for bandwidth efficiency because it has been designed as a
   general-purpose protocol.  EHCP aims to address this by leveraging a
   profile, expressed via the SCHC architecture, to optimize the ESP
   header sizes for better efficiency in constrained environments.

   Figure Figure 2 illustrates the integration of SCHC into the IPsec
   stack, detailing the different layers and components involved in the
   compression and decompression processes.  The diagram is divided into
   two entities, each representing an endpoint of a communication link.

   Rules for compression are derived from parameters associated with the
   Security Association (SA) and agreed upon via IKEv2 [RFC7296], as
   well as specific compression parameters defined for IKEv2 in
   [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension].

   Upon establishing the SA, Diet-ESP uses the parameters listed in
   Table Figure 5 for derivation of the SoR applicable to each SCHC
   stratum.  The collection of rules are then used for the SCHC Context
   initialization.  The reference column in Table Figure 5 indicates the
   source where the parameter value is defined.  The C/D column
   specifies in which of the SCHC strata the parameter is being used.

   EHCP defines three SCHC strata for compression: IIPC, CTEC, and EEC.
   The compression operations for each stratum are described in
   Section 5.1, Section 5.3, and Section 5.4.

   Note that additional compression could be performed, especially on
   the inner IP packet—for example, to include the TCP layer.  However,
   this profile limits the scope of the compression to the inner IP
   headers and UDP headers when available.  Further and more specific
   compression profiles may be defined in the future to cover
   compression of headers of different upper layer protocols.

   At the receiver endpoint, the decompression of the inbound packet
   follows a reverse process.  First, the Encrypted ESP C/D (EEC)
   decompresses the encrypted ESP header fields.  After the ESP packet
   is decrypted, the Clear Text ESP C/D (CTEC) decompresses the Clear
   Text fields of the ESP packet.

   Note that implementations MAY differ from the architectural
   description but it is assumed the outputs will be the same.

                Figure 3: Diet-ESP Compressed Header Format

   The SCHC Profile for Diet-ESP is defined as follows:

   RuleID:  The RuleID is a unique identifier for each SCHC rule.  It is
      included in packets to ensure the receiver applies the correct
      decompression rule, maintaining consistency in packet processing.
      Note that the Rule ID does not need to be explicitly agreed upon
      and can be defined independently by each party.  The RuleID in
      Diet-ESP is expressed as 1 byte.

   Maximum Packet Size:  MAX_PACKET_SIZE is determined by the specific
      IPsec ESP configuration and the underlying transport, but it is
      typically aligned with the network’s MTU.  The size constraints
      are optimized based on the available link capacity and negotiated
      parameters between endpoints.

   SCHC Padding:  Padding in SCHC is used to align data to a specific
      boundary (typically byte-aligned or 8-bit aligned) to meet the
      requirements of the underlying link layer protocol or encryption
      algorithm.  Padding bits are often zero or follow a pattern but do
      not contain significant data.  In Diet-ESP, The SCHC padding is
      added in the CTEC strata to align the packet for encryption.

   The resulting IP/ESP packet size is variable.  In some networks, the
   packet will require fragmentation before transmission over the wire.
   Fragmentation is out of the scope of this document since it is
   dependent on the layer 2 technology.

4.2.  Set of Rules (SoR) for Diet-ESP

   SCHC SoR are predefined sets of instructions that specify how to
   compress and decompress the header fields of an ESP packet.  The
   identification of a particular SoR will follow the specification in
   [I-D.ietf-schc-architecture].

   Similarly to the SA, Rules are directional and the Direction
   Indicator (DI) is set to Up for outbound SA and Down for inbound SA.
   Each Rule also contains a Field Position parameter that is set to 1,
   unless specified otherwise.

4.3.  Attributes for Rules Generation

   The list of attributes used for the Rules generation is shown in
   Table Figure 5.  These attributes are used to express the various
   compressions that operate at the IIPC, CTEC, and EEC layers.

   The compression of the Inner IP Packet is based on the attributes
   that are derived from the negotiated Traffic Selectors TSi/TSr, as
   described in [RFC7296], Section 3.13.  The Traffic Selectors may
   result in a quite complex expression, and this specification
   restricts that complexity.  In particular, Diet-ESP restricts the

   Traffic Selector to a single type of IP address (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6),
   a single protocol (such as UDP, TCP, or not relevant), a single port
   range, and multiple DSCP numbers.  Such simplification corresponds to
   the expression of an individual Traffic Selector Payload [RFC7296],
   Section 3.13.1.

   The ability to derive the EHCP Context for the IIPC from the agreed
   Traffic Selectors is indicated by the variable iipc_profile.

   Any parameter starting with "ts_" is associated with the Traffic
   Selectors of the SA.  The notation is introduced by this
   specification but the definition of the parameters is defined in
   [RFC4301] and [RFC7296].

   This specification limits the expression of the Traffic Selector to
   be of the form (IP source range, IP destination range, Port source
   range, Port destination range, Protocol ID list, DSCP list).  This
   limits the original flexibility of the expression of TS, but provides
   sufficient flexibility.

   The details of each parameter are the following:

   iipc_profile:  designates the profile used by IIPC.  When set to
      "uncompress" IIPC is not performed.  This specification describes
      IIPC that corresponds to the "diet-esp" profile.

   flow_label_cda:  indicates how the Flow Label field of the inner IPv6
      packet or the Identification field of the inner IPv4 packet is
      compressed / decompressed - See Section 4.3.1 for more
      information.  In a nutshell, "uncompress" indicates that Flow
      Label (resp.  Identification) are not compressed. "lower"
      indicates the value is read from the outer IP header - eventually
      with some adaptations when inner IP packet and outer IP pakets
      have different versions. "generated" indicates that the fields is
      generated by the receiving party.  In that case, the decompressed
      value may take a different value its original value. "zero"
      indicates the field is set to zero.

   dscp_cda:  indicates how the DSCP values of the inner IP packet are
      generated.  (See flow_label_cda). "sa" indicates, compression is
      performed according to the DSCP values agreed by the SA
      (dscp_list).

   ecn_cda:  indicates how the ECN values of the inner IP packet are
      generated.  (See flow_label_cda).

   ts_ip_version:  designates the IP version of the Traffic Selectors
      and its value is set to "IPv4-only" when only IPv4 IP addresses
      are considered and to "IPv6-only" when only IPv6 addresses are
      considered.  Practically, when IKEv2 is used, it means that the
      agreed TSi or TSr results only in a mutually exclusive combination
      of TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE or TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE payloads.

   ts_ip_src_start:  designates the starting value range of source IP
      addresses of the inner packet and has the same meaning as the
      Starting Address field of the Traffic Selector payload defined in
      [RFC7296], Section 3.13.

   ts_ip_src_end:  designates the high end value range of source IP
      addresses of the inner packet and has the same meaning as the
      Ending Address field of the Traffic Selector payload defined in
      [RFC7296], Section 3.13.

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      October 2024


   ts_port_src_start:  designates the starting value of the port range
      of the inner packet and has the same meaning as the Start Port
      field of the Traffic Selector payload defined in [RFC7296],
      Section 3.13.

   ts_port_src_end:  designates the starting value of the port range of
      the inner packet and has the same meaning as the End Port field of
      the Traffic Selector payload defined in [RFC7296], Section 3.13.

   IP addresses and ports are defined as a range and compressed using
   the LSB.  For a range defined by start and end values, msb( start,
   end ) is defined as the function that returns the MSB that remains
   unchanged while the value evolves between start and end.  Similarly,
   lsb( start, end ) is defined as the function that returns the LSB
   that changes while the value evolves between start and end.  Finally,
   len( x ) is defined as the function that returns the number of bits
   of the bit array x.

   ts_proto:  designates the list of Protocol ID field, whose meaning is
      defined in [RFC7296], Section 3.13.  This profile considers the
      specific protocols values "TCP", "UDP", "UDP-Lite", "SCTP",
      "OTHER" and "ANY".  "OTHER" designates any protocol values that
      are not in :"TCP", "UDP", "UDP-Lite", "SCTP.  "ANY" as defined in
      [RFC5996], Section 3.13 and designates any possible values.

   dscp_list:  designates the list of DSCP values with the same meaning
      as the List of DSCP Values defined in [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-dscp-np].
      These are not Traffic Selector, but the compression mandates the
      packets takes one of these listed DSCP value.

   alignment:  indicates the byte alignement supported by the OS for the
      ESP extension.  By default, the alignement is 32 bit for IPv6, but
      some systems may also support an 8 bit alignement.  Note that when
      a block cipher such as AES-CCM is used, an 128 bit alignment is
      overwritten by the block size.

   ipsec_mode:  designates the IPsec mode defined in [RFC4301].  In this
      document, the possible values are "tunnel" for the Tunnel mode and
      "transport" for the Transport mode.

   tunnel_ip:  designates the IP address of the tunnel defined in
      [RFC4301].  This field is only applicable when the Tunnel mode is
      used.  That IP address can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   esp_encr:  designates the encryption algorithm used.  For the purpose
      of compression it is RECOMMENDED to use algorithms that already
      compresse their IV [RFC8750].

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      October 2024


   esp_spi:  designates the Security Policy Index defined in [RFC4301].

   esp_spi_lsb:  designates the LSB to be considered for the compressed
      SPI.  A value of 32 for esp_spi_lsb will leave the SPI unchanged.

      This parameter is defined by this specification and can take the
      following values 0, 1, 2, 4 respectively meaning that the
      compressed SPI will consist of the esp_spi_lsb LSB bytes of the
      original SPI.  A value of 4 for esp_spi_lsb will leave the SPI
      unchanged.

   esp_sn:  designates the Sequence Number (SN) field defined in
      [RFC4301].

   esp_sn_lsb:  designates the LSB to be considered for the compressed
      SN and is defined by this specification.  It works similarly to
      esp_spi_lsb.

4.3.1.  Compression/Decompression Actions in Diet-ESP

   In addition to the Compression/Decompression Actions (CDAs) defined
   in [RFC8724], Section 7.4, this specification uses the CDAs presented
   in Figure 6.  These CDAs are either a refinement of the compute- *
   CDA or the result of a combined CDA.

      +========================+=============+======================+
      | Action                 | Compression | Decompression        |

      field is generated following [RFC6437], [RFC6864].

   checksum:  indicates that a checksum is computed accordingly.

      Typically, the checksum CDA has a different implementation for
      IPv4, UDP, TCP,...

   ESP padding:  indicates that the ESP padding bytes are generated
      accordingly.

   hop limit:  indicates that the hop limit is derived from the outer
      IPv6 header.

   SCHC padding:  indicates that the SCHC padding bits are generated
      accordingly.

5.  SCHC Compression for IPsec in Tunnel mode

5.1.  Inner IP Compression (IIPC)

   When iipc_profile is set to "uncompress", the packet is uncompressed.
   When iipc_profile is set to "diet-esp", IIPC proceeds to the
   compression of the inner IP Packet composed of an IP Header and an IP
   Payload.  The compression of the inner IP Payload is described in
   Section 5.1.1.
   The IP Header is compressed when ipsec_mode is set to "Tunnel" and
   left uncompressed otherwise. ts_ip_version determines how the IPv6
   Header (resp. the IPv4 header) is compressed - see Section 5.1.2
   (resp.  Section 5.1.3).

5.1.1.  Inner IP Payload Compression

   The compression only affects UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP or SCTP packets and
   the type of packet is determined by the IP header.

   For UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP and SCTP packets, source ports destination
   ports and checksums are compressed.  For source port (resp.
   destination port) only the least significant bits are sent.  FL is
   set to 16 bits, TV is set to msb( ts_port_src_start, ts_port_src_end
   ) ( resp. ts_port_dst_start, ts_port_dst_end ) ), MO is set to "MSB"
   and CDA to "LSB".  The checksum is elided, FL is set to 16 bits, TV
   is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "checksum".  This
   may result in decompressing a zero-checksum UDP packet with a valid
   checksum, but this has no impact as a valid checksum is universally
   accepted.

   For UDP or UDP-Lite the length field is elided.  FL is set to 16, TV
   is not set, MO is set to "ignore".

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      October 2024


5.1.2.  Inner IPv6 Header Compression

   The version field is elided, FL is set to 3, TV is set to
   ts_ipversion, MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".

   Traffic Class is composed of the 6 bit DSCP and 2 bit ECN.  The
   compression of DSCP and ECN are defined independently.

   DSCP values are compressed according to the dscp_cda value: * If
   dscp_cda is set to "uncompress", the DSCP values are included in the
   inner IP header.  FL is set to 6 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to
   "ignore", CDA is set to "sent-value". * If dscp_cda is set to
   "lower", the DSCP field is elided and its value is copied from the
   Tunnel IP header.  FL is set to 6 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to
   "ignore", CDA is set to "lower". * If dscp_cda is set to "sa", DSCP
   is compressed according to the DSCP values of the SA.  If dscp_list
   contains a single element, the DSCP is elided, FL is set to 6 bits,
   TV is set to dscp_list[0], MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to
   "not-sent".  If dscp_list contains more than one DSCP value, FL is
   set to 6 bits, TV is set to dscp_list, MO is set to "match-mapping"
   and the CDA is set to "mapping-sent".  For ECN, FL is set to 2 bits,
   TV is not set, MO is set to ignore and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   ECN values are compressed according to the ecn_cda value: * If
   ecn_cda is set to "uncompress", the ECN field included in the inner
   IP header.  FL is set to 2 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to
   "ignore", CDA is set to "sent-value". * If ecn_cda is set to "lower",
   the ECN value is elided and the ECN value is copied in the outer IP
   header.  FL is set to 2 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore",
   CDA is set to "lower".

   Flow label is compressed according to the flow_label_cda value: * If
   flow_label_cda is set to "uncompress", the Flow label is included in
   the IPv6 Header.  FL is set to 20 bits, TV is not set MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to "sent-value". * If flow_label_cda is set
   to "lower", the Flow Label is elided and read from the outer IP
   Header (See Section 4.3.1).  FL is set to 20 bits, TV is not set, MO
   is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "lower".  If the outer IP header
   is an IPv4 header, only the 16 LSB of the FLow Label are inserted
   into the IPv4 Header.  At the decompression, the 4 MSB of the Flow
   Label are set to 0.  * If flow_label_cda is set to "generated", the
   Flow Label elided and the Flow Label is then re-generated at the
   decompression (See Section 4.3.1).  The resulting Flow Label differs
   from the initial value.  FL is set to 20, TV is not set, MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to "generated".  * If flow_label_cda is set
   to "zero", the Flow Label is elided and set to 0 at decompression.  A
   0 value indicates no flow label is present.  Fl is set to 20 bits, TV
   is set to 0, MO is set to "equal" and CDA is set to "not-sent".

Internet-Draft                    EHCP                      October 2024


   Payload Length is elided and determined from the Tunnel IP Header
   Payload Length as well as the decompressed Payload.  FL is set to 16
   bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is set to "lower".

   Next Header is compressed according to ts_proto: * If ts_proto is the
   single value 0, Next Header is not compressed.  FL is set to 8 bits,
   TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore", CDA is set to "sent-value". *
   If ts_proto is a single non zero value, Next Header is compressed.
   FL is set to 8 bits, TV is set to ts_proto, MO is set to "equal" and
   CDA is set to "not-sent".

   The IPv6 Hop Limit is read from the Tunnel IP Header Hop Limit.  FL
   is set to 8 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set
   to "lower."

   The source and destination IPv6 addresses are compressed using MSB.
   In both cases, FL is set to 128, TV is respectively set to
   msb(ts_ip_src_start, ts_ip_src_ed) or msb(ts_ip_dst_start,
   ts_ip_dst_end)), the MO is set to "MSB," and the CDA is set to "LSB."

5.1.3.  Inner IPv4 Header Compression

   The fields Version, DSCP, ECN, Source Address and Destination Address
   are compressed as described for IPv6 in Section 5.1.2.  The field
   Total Length (16 bits) is compressed similarly to the IPv6 field
   Payload Length.  The field Identification (16 bits) is compressed
   similarly to the IPv6 field Flow Label.  If the IP Header is an IPv6
   Header, the Identification are placed as the LSB of the IPv6 Header
   and the 4 remaining MSB are set to 0.  The field Time to Live is
   compressed similarly to the IPv6 Hop Limit field.  The Protocol field
   is compressed similarly to the last IPv6 Next Header field.

   IHL is uncompressed, FL is set to 4 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to
   ignore and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   The IPv4 Header checksum is elided.  FL is set to 16, TV is omitted,
   MO is set to "ignore," and CDA is set to "checksum."

5.2.  ESP Data Byte alignment

   SCHC operates on bits, while protocols like ESP expect payloads to be
   aligned to byte boundaries (8-bit alignment).  To ensure this, we
   apply a padding by appending the SCHC_padding bits and the
   SCHC_padding_len.  SCHC_padding_len is encoded over 3 bits to encode
   the values 0-7.  SCHC_padding are randomy generated.  Let's call the
   complementing bits, the bits that are needed to have a byte boundary.
   If the complementing bits are less or equal to 2 bits, the padding
   will result in adding an extra byte.

5.3.  Clear Text ESP Compression (CTEC)

   The Clear Text ESP Compression is applied to compress the unencrypted
   ESP fields, including the ESP Payload Data and the Next Header field,
   which indicates the type of the inner packet.

   SCHC Compression efficiently compresses the Next Header field,
   reducing overhead and aligning the packet to byte boundaries using
   SCHC Padding.  After this, the SCHC Pad Length field is added.  If
   required by the encryption algorithm, additional ESP Padding and Pad
   Length fields are introduced to ensure the packet fits the specified
   encryption block size.

   In tunnel mode, the Next Header field is elided as the inner IP
   packet (either IPv4 or IPv6) is determined by the Traffic Selector,
   which is expressed by a single Traffic Selector Payload in the SA.

   The ESP Padding and Pad Length fields are reduced by the SCHC
   compression rule.  This process minimizes the size of the Clear Text
   ESP packet by eliminating unnecessary padding, while maintaining
   proper alignment for transmission.  The ESP Padding and Pad Length
   may differ from the decompressed versions due to alignment
   requirements, which depend on the maximum of the encryption block
   alignment or the IPv6 Header alignment (32 bits).  Since the padding
   is stripped by the IPsec process, these differences do not impact
   packet processing.  This is expressed as FL is defined by the type
   that is to (Pad Length + 1 ) * 8 bits, TV is unset, MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to padding.

5.4.  Encrypted ESP Compression (EEC)

   SPI is compressed to its LSB.  FL is set to 32 bits, TV is not set,
   MO is set to "MSB( 4 - esp_spi_lsb)" and CDA is set to "LSB".

   If the esp_encr considers implicit IV [RFC8750], Sequence Numbers are
   not compressed.  Otherwise, SN are compressed to their LSB similarly
   to the SPI.  FL is set to 32 bits, TV is not set, MO is set to "MSB(
   4 - esp_spi_lsb)" and CDA is set to "LSB".

   Note that the use of implicit IV always result in a better
   compression as a 64 bit IV to be sent while compression of the SN
   alone results at best in a reduction of 32 bits.

   The IPv6 Next Header field or the IPv4 Protocol that contains the
   "ESP" value is changed to "SCHC".

6.  SCHC Compression for IPsec in Transport mode

   The transport mode mostly differ from the Tunnel mode in that the IP
   header of the packet is not encrypted.  As a result, the IP Payload
   is compressed as described in Section 5.1.1.  The IP header is not
   compressed.  The byte alignment of the Compressed Payload is
   performed as described in Section 5.2.  The Clear Text ESP
   Compression is performed as described in Section 5.3 except for the
   Next Header Field which is compressed as described in Section 5.1.2

Appendix A.  JSON format Context

   The JSON file defines a set of rules within the SCHC_Context that are
   used for compressing and decompressing ESP headers.  Each rule has a
   RuleID, a Description, and a set of Fields.  Each field specifies how
   a particular part of the packet should be handled during compression
   or decompression.  Note that the RuleID can be set by the user in any
   numeric order.  Each rule is defined with a compression_level,
   indicating which level of the ESP packet structure (IIPC, CTEC, or
   EEC) the rule applies to, as defined in the Terminology section.
